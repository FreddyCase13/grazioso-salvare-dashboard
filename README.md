How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following Object Oriented Programming guidelines.
    My code is maintainable since I encapsulate database logic through a dedicated CRUD class instead of writing a long script.
    My code is readable from organizing the program into classes and methods so that it is easy to understand what each part of the application does.
    My code is adaptable because my CRUD class can be used for many different applications, not just this one, with minor to no code changes.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

  I approach a problem as a computer scientist by first reading the requirements given to me to understand what I am trying to accomplish.
  Then I plan on what I am going to do through visual graphs or pseudocode before I start to give me direction on where I want to go. This is by breaking down each problem one by one until its solved.
  I go through problems by trial and error by constantly testing the code and fixing the bugs as I go by researching the bugs or error messages.
  Working on my first full-stack project has allowed me to understand that good software depends on many different functions working together.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

  Computer scientists solve problems for people by using programming languages on a computer to tell it what to do in order to solve real world solutions for others.
  It matters because the modern systems used today to push our economy and society depend on state of the art software to function properly and solve a problem the marketplace needs to be solved.
